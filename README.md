minesweeper: 
Rules of the game
At the beginning of the game, the player has to enter the size of the board (number of rows and columns).
Each block of the board may hide a mine. The player's goal is to find all blocks without mines before touching them.
The player can choose to clear a block or mark a block. Clearing a block will reveal whether it has a mine or not. Marking a block will help the player remember which blocks may have mines.
If the player clears a block with mines, the game ends immediately. If the player clears all blocks without mines, the player wins.
After each round, the system displays the number of remaining mines, the number of marked mines, and how many mines are left unmarked.
How to run
From the command line, run python minesweeper.py.
